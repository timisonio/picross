Some fun little Picross (aka nonograms) scripts


## clues.py
This script is to read puzzles in the format used by Devin Morgan here:
http://www.gamefaqs.com/gameboy/563278-marios-picross/faqs/6189

Right now it can do one puzzle at a time and create the correct clues/

The idea is that these functions can be used to write another script to
parse that entire file and import the puzzles.
